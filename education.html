                <p> 
                    I went to Northeastern for 5 years to pursue a degree in biology with the idea of going to medical school after graduating. During my final year
                    at Northeastern I was called by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Joyner">Al Joyner</a>, who invited me to train at the Olympic Training Center
                    in California. This decision ended up changing the course of where I thought my degree would bring me.

                <h2><b>Professional Athletics</b></h2>
                <p> While athletics is not necessarily education, accepting the offer to train professionlly in California changed the trajectory of my future from going to medical 
                    school to now being an athlete, and eventually discovering my true passion. I would go on to earn earn All-American status for placing top 8 in the country for 
                    long jumpers and compete at the Olympic Trials in 2021. After a few years of competing, I decided that although althetics are great, it won't last forever and 
                    it's not what I want to do in the future. So I began looking at other potential options and interests and eventually discovered software engineering.

                <h2><b>Boston University</b></h2> 
                    <p> From my hobbies sparked an interest in game design, which then introduced me to the world of software engineering. Since discovering and learning software engineering
                        in 2020, I have not stopped in my pursuit to become a software engineer. I have learned many skills over the years and continue to grow in my knowledge with hopes of 
                        getting a job in a great company who I can learn more from and grow as an engineer. BU is the catalyst to my success in the future, and I will always have the school 
                        to thank for the skills i've learned.
